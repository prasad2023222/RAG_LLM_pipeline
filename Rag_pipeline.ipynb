You can re-watch, revise, or attend the next batch's live classes (as and when they happen) with lifetime validity.\\nWhat are the prerequisites for the course?\\r\\nBasics of Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Videos are provided for these topics. So, the only prerequisites are an internet connection and a hunger for learning.\\nIs Machine Learning a prerequisite for the course?\\r\\nAll the basic fundamentals required for Generative AI will be taught in the course. You do not need to have any prior knowledge of Machine Learning or AI.\\nHow many projects will we work on? Can I add these to my resume?\\r\\nWe will work on 10 projects that you can add to your resume.\\nIs this course for freshers or experienced people?\\r\\nThis course is for anyone who wants to build projects and understand Generative AI. Years of experience do not matter.\\nHow will you be able to cover so much in 7 weeks?\\r\\nYou can check out testimonials – if you are consistent with the course, we promise that you will surprise yourself. This course will make you very confident in working with trending and future-defining technologies.\\nWhat languages do we use to build the projects?\\r\\nPython.\\nCan I watch the classes only on my phone without a laptop?\\r\\nYes, you can watch the classes on your phone without a laptop. However, it is a hands-on course, so it is better to code as we proceed.\\nWill you provide the code?\\r\\nYes!\\nWhere can I ask my doubts?\\r\\nThe Discord community will always be active!\\nWhat language will the course be taught in?\\r\\nEverything will be taught in English.\\nDo you have a mobile application?\\r\\nWe have a mobile application for both Android and iOS.\\nCan I watch the class recordings or go through notes offline?\\r\\nYou can download the recordings and notes on the mobile application and use them offline at your convenience.\\nDo you provide a certificate for the course?\\r\\nThe certificate of completion is available.\\nCan I get invoices for reimbursement?\\r\\nYes, a proper invoice with GSTIN is available as soon as you enroll in the course.\\nI have more questions. How can I reach out to you?\\r\\nDrop us a mail at support@educosys.com.No records foundLoading...No test series foundPRICE₹11,999 ₹19,99940.00% offChoose Currency:Buy NowQuick LinksTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyRefunds & Cancellation Policy\")]\n"
